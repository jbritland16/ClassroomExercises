This project is a group of microservices designed for a banking app.
It was designed to showcase my skill with Spring Boot, data handling, and back-end logic, so it currently has no user interface.
If you'd like to test it, you can read the instructions on Confluence and use Postman or another endpoint software.
Either way, I invite you to look through my code to see how the days is structured and how the logic works.
Thank you for viewing my project!
